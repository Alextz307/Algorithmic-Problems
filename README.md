# Algorithmic-Problems
A collection of algorithmic problems created by me, hosted on some Romanian online judges. Problem statements on the online judges are usually written in Romanian, but for each problem there will be a short summary in English created by me and a link to a judge for submitting solutions (C++ solutions are usually preferred and you should be careful if you need to use files or standard input and output).

Note: The repository is still in work, as there are more problems to be added.
