# Algorithmic-Problems
A collection of algorithmic problems created by me, hosted on the largest Romanian Online Judge, [pbInfo](https://www.pbinfo.ro/). Problemes statements on the judge are written in Romanian, but for each problem there will be a short summary in English created by me and a link to the judge for submitting solutions (C++ solutions are usually preferred and you should be careful if you need to you use files ore standard input and output).
